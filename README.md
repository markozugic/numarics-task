# Numarics-task

This repository consists of two Spring Boot microservices.

You can start the services with the run.sh script.

Services provide Swagger endpoints for easier testing:

Game Service: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/

Player Service: http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html#/

Some dummy data is seeded on application run

You can see the databases at http://localhost:{8080,8081}/h2-console
